## House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and more. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that helps in understanding the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

## Introduction

Predicting house prices is a common application of machine learning in the real estate industry. By building a linear regression model, we aim to accurately estimate the market value of a house based on its features. This project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes house features such as:
- Size (square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location (latitude, longitude)
- Year built
- Other relevant features

You can download the dataset from [HousePricePrediction.xlsx].

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with several libraries. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   

3. Install the required dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 ## Usage

1. Preprocess the data:
   - Clean and normalize the data.
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Perform feature scaling.

2. Train the linear regression model:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model on the training set.
   - Evaluate the model on the testing set.

3. Make predictions:
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices on new data.
   - Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

You can run the provided Jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb to see the full implementation and analysis.

## Results

The results section includes:
- Model performance metrics (MAE, RMSE).
- Visualizations of actual vs. predicted prices.
- Analysis of feature importance.
